<div class="middle">
    <p style="padding-left: 200px; padding-right: 200px;"> I created this site as a space for people to express gratitude in a way, that is not entirely private
    while not being as public as saying it directly to other people, which may make people more shy. At the same time,
    I also wanted a space where you dont need to be a movie star for people to hear your moments of graitiude. By nature, we are all treated equally on here.</p>
