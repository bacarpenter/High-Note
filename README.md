## Take aways:
Wow, the end of CS50. I did know if i'd see the class through this far, but here I am. At the end of the road. Making this project was alot of fun, and encompases a lot of what I learned. I took time to make things effecant, and smooth. Though about what it felt like as a user, and put those thoughts into my UI/UX. However, if you go thorugh the readme, you will notice that some of my checkmarks are left unchecked. I decided to leave these in, as a remindeder to my self that there is always more work that could be done. I hope you can enjoy the site just as much as I enjoyed making it.

With love,
Ben Carpenter
